Welcome to **MonkeyCalculator**, a simple yet functional calculator created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! This calculator allows users to calculate using both **mouse** and **keyboard** inputs. It also includes a history section where you can review your previous calculations, and this data is saved for later use.
