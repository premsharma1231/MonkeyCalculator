Hi everyone, my name is Purvish, and today I'm sharing a very simple calculator that I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use the mouse to calculate, or you can use the keyboard. It also has a history section that you can choose to see or hide, and it saves the data you've calculated. You can also view the design because I've included a screenshot of the project that shows you how the history section is displayed and hidden so you can see it and provide feedback. This is a pretty rudimentary calculator, but I intend to commit to a really nice and advanced one, so please stay tuned and thank you.
Our MonkeyCalculator is now available at https://premsharma1231.github.io/MonkeyCalculator/. Because it is a responsive website, you may use it on both desktop and mobile devices, so please visit, utilize, and enjoy.
